### Acknowledgments & AI Collaboration
Throughout this course, I focused on translating mathematical theory into functional Python code. 

**Note on AI Assistance:**
I utilized **Gemini (AI)** to assist with the following aspects of this portfolio:
* **Code Optimization:** Refining the loop structures in the iterative solvers (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel) for better performance.
* **Refactoring:** Organizing individual scripts into a clean, modular repository structure.


This collaboration helped me ensure that my implementations follow best practices in both mathematics and software development.
